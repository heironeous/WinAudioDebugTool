# TODO — Windows Audio Device Debugger

Feature checklist. Boxes are checked once the corresponding code is written and
committed. Because development happens inside a Linux container, "checked"
means **implemented and committed**, not "verified on real hardware" — see
`README.md` for the manual Windows test pass this still needs.

## Project scaffolding
- [x] Git repository initialized (`Aral Kaymaz` / `aralcan@hotmail.com`)
- [x] `.gitignore` for .NET build artifacts
- [x] Solution + WPF project scaffolding (`.sln`, `.csproj`)
- [x] NAudio dependency wired up for Core Audio access
- [x] `README.md` describing layout, build, run, and test instructions

## Device enumeration
- [x] Enumerate all active output (render) devices
- [x] Enumerate all active input (capture) devices
- [x] Include disabled / unplugged / not-present devices (with state shown)
- [x] "Refresh" button that re-enumerates devices and diffs against current list
- [x] Toolbar "Show:" checkboxes, one per non-active state — Disabled,
      Not present, Unplugged — each with its device count (Disabled and
      Not present hidden by default, Unplugged shown; Active always shown)
- [x] Auto-refresh on Windows device change notifications (plug/unplug events)

## Default device roles
- [x] Show current default device for Render / Multimedia role
- [x] Show current default device for Render / Communications role
- [x] Show current default device for Capture / Multimedia role
- [x] Show current default device for Capture / Communications role
- [x] "Set Default" toolbar button for the selected device (Console + Multimedia roles)
- [x] "Set Comms" toolbar button for the selected device (Communications role)
- [x] "Set Both" toolbar button (Default + Communications in one click);
      all three are disabled unless the selected device is Active
- [x] Visual indicator in the device list for current defaults ("Role" column badge)

## Device details panel
- [x] Friendly name, endpoint ID, data flow, device state
- [x] Default format: sample rate, bit depth, channel count (shared-mode mix format)
- [x] Shared-mode mix format vs. exclusive-mode supported formats
- [x] Raw property store dump (all discoverable `PROPERTYKEY` values, via `device.Properties`)
- [x] Details panel rendering in the UI (name, ID, formats, property grid)
- [x] Layout: device list on top, details below (resizable); property table
      collapses to a strip at the right edge (collapsed by default) and the
      property store is only read while the table is open
- [x] Human-readable property names: compiled-in table of all ~1,550 documented
      PKEY_/DEVPKEY_ keys generated from Win32 metadata
      (`tools/PropertyKeyNameGenerator` → `Interop/PropertyKeyNames.g.cs`) plus a
      manual table for confirmed undocumented keys; unknown keys keep their UID
- [ ] Name more undocumented endpoint keys (~185 distinct on the dev machine,
      e.g. `{b3f8fa53-0004-438e-9003-51a46e139bfc},*`) once their meaning is confirmed

## Testing devices
- [x] "Test" button per device row — plays a tone for outputs, records 5s
      and plays it back for inputs
- [x] Start/stop toggle on the Test button (▶ / ■): stopping an output test
      ends the tone; stopping an input test ends recording early and still
      plays the capture back (stop again to cut the playback)
- [x] Input tests show their phase on the button: "Test ■" while recording,
      "Playback ■" while playing the recording back
- [x] Test audio is converted to the output's shared-mode mix format (channel
      count + sample rate), so e.g. a 4-channel mic array plays back on stereo
      speakers (previously failed with E_INVALIDARG)
- [x] Clear pass/fail + error reporting if a device fails to open/start
      (shown in the bottom status bar)

## Volume control
- [x] Per-device volume slider (0–100%) + mute toggle in every active row,
      via `IAudioEndpointVolume` (`EndpointVolumeService`) — same setting as
      Windows' volume flyout; mic level for inputs
- [x] Stays in sync with external changes (flyout, media keys, other apps)
      via `OnVolumeNotification`; own changes are tagged with an event-context
      GUID so they don't echo back into the slider while dragging

## Live level metering
- [x] Real-time peak-level meter per device using `IAudioMeterInformation`
      — `LevelMeterService`. All Core Audio objects live on one dedicated
      MTA polling thread (IMMDevice can't cross from the UI STA: E_NOINTERFACE).
      Inputs get a silent shared-mode capture stream, since Windows only
      feeds a capture endpoint's meter while something records from it
- [x] Rolling graph (time-series) for the selected device — `LevelGraph`
      control in the detail panel
- [x] Simultaneous mini-meters next to every device in the list — a live
      `ProgressBar` per row, all updating independently and concurrently
- [x] Per-channel peak levels where the endpoint reports more than stereo
      (`SelectedDeviceChannelPeaks` in `MainViewModel`, rendered as a row of
      vertical bars below the rolling graph in the detail panel)

## Packaging
- [x] `dotnet publish` profile for a single self-contained `.exe`
      (`Properties/PublishProfiles/win-x64-selfcontained.pubxml`)
- [x] App icon / metadata (version, product name) — `Assets/app.ico` +
      `app.manifest` (DPI awareness, OS compatibility, no elevation) wired
      up via `ApplicationIcon`/`ApplicationManifest` in the `.csproj`

## Not yet done / follow-ups
- [ ] Manual verification pass on a real Windows machine (blocked: this
      environment is Linux-only, see README "Testing" section)
- [ ] Automated UI tests (no Windows test runner available in this container)
- [ ] Code signing of the published executable
